## Overview of python files and their functions


*closes_distance.py: calculates the closes distance between two points
*colorvalue_test.py: click anywhere in an image to get the color information and location of that pixel
*concavepoint.py: code of the convepoint algorithm
*connected_components.py: counts all connected compontents (based on 8-connectivity) in an image)
*crop_images.py: crops random sections with a specified size from an images
*evaluation.py: compares output data from the algorithms with groundtruth data (csv-files) and saves a summary of the metrics
*evaluation_automated.py: runs specified algorithm with specified lists of values for each parameters and evaluates all the data automatically
*graphs.py: generate matplotlib graphics for parameter selection
*grayvalue_distribution_bubbles.py: small tool to compare a cross section of bubble gray values
*histogram.py: generate histogram/probability density function for the output data
*hough.py: code of the hough algorithm
*hypothesis.py: calculates the hypothesis test for the data
*mark.py: tool to manually mark/annotate the bubbles from the real images
*psnr.py: calculate peak-signal-to-noise ratio
*randomellipsis.py: tool to generate synthetic ellipse images based on parameter distribution from the real data set
*randomellipsis_calibration.py: small tool to summarize data from the real data set for the random ellipse generator
*run_algorithm.py: automation to run the algorithm on multiple pictures automatically
*run_evaluation.py: automation to run the evaluaiton on output data from multiple images automatically
*scatter.py: generates scatter plot for smd values
*threshold.py: tool to test threshold values and visualize them instantaneously (with sliders)
*watershed.py: code of the watershed algorithm
*watershed_visualization.py: small tool to make a graphic visualization of the watershed algorithm
